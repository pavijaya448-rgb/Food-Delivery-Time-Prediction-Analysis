# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-Analysis
Excited to share my project on Logistic Regression using PYTHON.
Skills used : Data Cleaning,Feature Engineering,Logistic Regression.
I uploaded the ipynb file that gives the cleaned dataset to make predictions.
The prediction is about the food delivery is slow or fast by using Logistic Regression Model.
The dataset is taken from the kaggle website.
The link of this dataset is given below to understand the problem statement.

# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction-Analysis
Excited to share my project on Logistic Regression using PYTHON.The project gives the delivery time prediction using linear model Logistic Regresssion.
I uploaded the ipynb file that gives, the dataset is cleaned and the predictions are made clearly.
The dataset is taken from the kaggle website.
The link of this dataset is given below to understand the problem statement.
